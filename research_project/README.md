# Research Project (Machine Learning Lab)

This was the third semester research project where we were tasked with leveraging machine learning to solve problems. The focus of the module was on the process involved in understanding a research problem and being able to implement a machine learning based solution.

The report, titled `Predicting Energy Consumption.pdf` is included in the repository. The code files will be uploaded soon.
